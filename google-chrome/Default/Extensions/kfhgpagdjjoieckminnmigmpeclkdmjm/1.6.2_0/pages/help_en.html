        <ul>
          <li>
            This extension will automatically claim your Drops, Channel Points
            and Moments. Just watch your favorite streams, no need to set up
            anything.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can always check claims history, the time of the last claims, as
            well as the total number of claimed Drops, Points and Moments.
            <span class="important"
              >Note that the counters only show what is claimed by the extension
              itself and not automatically given to you by Twitch (for example,
              Channel Points for participating in the Raid).</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            The extension keeps track of some events that occur on streams. You
            can set up alerts for different events and view their history.
          </li>
          <li>
            All your settings, statistics, claims and events history are
            synchronized between devices with browsers where you are signed in
            to your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            The extension also works in Twitch players opened in a popup window
            or embedded in another site. However, some features may be limited.
          </li>
          <li class="important">
            The extension performs its actions in the background without relying
            on the interface, so you can still see notifications about available
            Drops, Moments or buttons for claiming Points. There is no point in
            clicking on them.
          </li>
          <li class="important">
            The browser may automatically interrupt streams playback, especially
            if they are in hidden tabs and with the sound turned off. To make
            sure playback doesn't get interrupted, don't open too many tabs and
            keep your stream in an active (not minimized) tab.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="alerts">Alerts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can set up alerts when receiving Drops, Channel Points or
            Moments separately for each type.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also separately turn on only the sound, the operating system
            alert, or the pop-up alert, or you can turn it on all together.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can immediately test alerts to decide on the settings.
            <span class="important"
              >Test alerts are included in the claims history, but do not affect
              the total counters.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Pop-up alerts are displayed on all pages on the Twitch site and are
            visible even in the player in full screen mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alerts for different types of events are configured similarly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="history">Claims History</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can always check the claims history of Drops, Channel Points and
            Moments.
            <span class="important"
              >It only stores what is claimed by the extension itself, and not
              what is claimed by you manually or issued automatically.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>You can filter the history by the type of rewards.</li>
          <li class="important">
            Due to storage limits, only the last 10 Drops, 10 Moments, and 20
            Channel Points groups are included in the history.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
        <p>
          To improve your experience on the Twitch site, the extension offers
          additional features that you can always toggle in the settings.
        </p>

        <h4 id="settings_raid-cancel">Channel Raid Prevention</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The extension will prevent the transition to the Raided channel.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this case, the Raided page will be loaded for a short time and
            returned back. Thus, you will receive bonus Points for participating
            in the Raid.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="settings_stream-preview">

        </h4>
        <ul>

            This feature will bring back the stream preview images displayed
            when you hover over the channels in the side menu.
          </li>
          <li class="important">
            New previews are generated every 10 minutes, this time cannot be
            reduced.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="settings_extensions-hide">Hiding Twitch Extensions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            With this feature, you can hide extensions that are overlaid on top
            of the video player (installed through the Twitch site itself).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="settings_icon-swap">Tab Icon Swap</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To always know if a stream playback is running in a minimized tab,
            you can enable this feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Twitch icon for tabs with an active player will turn red.
            <span class="important"
              >However, it will only change for live streams, not for video
              recordings or Hosted and Raided streams.</span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Hold the left mouse button on the player for half a second and
            release.
          </li>
          <li>Playback will be paused.</li>

          <li>
            The extension will reload the page if it detects a block while
            claiming reward.
          </li>

            In this case, the page will be reloaded no more than once every 10

        </ul>

        <h4 id="settings_reload-playback">Automatic Player Restart</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The extension will restart the player if it freezes or encounters an
            error. If the player fails to reload, the entire page will be
            reloaded.
          </li>
          <li class="important">
            In this case, the page will be reloaded no more than once every 5
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even if you lose internet, all Twitch pages will be automatically

        <ul>
          <li>
            Your browser may pause the video player if you leave a tab with a
            player, that is muted.
          </li>
          <li>
            The extension will unmute the video player for a second (while
            setting the volume to minimum) to prevent this browser action.

        <ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The browser has a mechanism that clears tabs that have not been used
            for a long time to save resources. This feature will help you avoid
            discarding your Twitch tabs.
          </li>

        <h3 id="errors">Information About Errors</h3>

        <h4 id="errors_playback">Video Stream Playback Error</h4>
        <p>
          This error will occur if the extension detects a Twitch player freeze
          or errors while making requests to the Twitch server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason may be unstable Internet or its disruption on your side. In
          this case: <b>check Internet connection</b> /
          <b>turn off the player's "Low Latency" mode</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the reason may be the temporary degradation of the Twitch
          servers. In this case: <b>check the status</b> on the
          <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport" target="_blank"
            >Twitch Support Twitter</a
          >
          / <b>just wait</b>.
        </p>

        <h4 id="errors_integrity">Reward Claiming Block</h4>
        <p>
          This error will occur if the extension determines that it is not
          possible to claim a reward, such as bonus Points or a Drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          This error occurs when the Twitch anti-bot system puts your IP address
          in a shadowban. There can be many reasons for that, but the main ones
          are your IP change or a large number of requests from it. IP changes
          can happen if you use a VPN, also some ISPs may change your IP on a
          regular basis. A large number of requests can occur if there are many
          computers (with Twitch opened) on your IP, some ISPs connect many
          households to one public IP.
        </p>
        <p class="important">
          The extension itself cannot be the cause of this error! At the moment,
          this shadowban does not affect your account and is automatically
          removed after a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case of this error: <b>wait a couple of hours</b> /
          <b>change your IP address</b> / <b>re-login on Twitch</b> /
          <b>clear browser cache and cookies</b>,
          <b>write to Twitch support</b>.
